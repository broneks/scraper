        "With Inbox, you can provide your users and visitors with support that’s simple, prompt and personal. Intercom offers a suite of features for your team to handle conversations like a traditional ticketing system, without losing the personal experience of the Messenger. You get the best of both worlds. ",
        "The team inbox is easy to scan, helping you see who and how many users and visitors are waiting for a reply. The conversation list shows you the last message from a customer, if they're typing currently, how long they've been waiting and if the conversation is marked as priority or has an SLA set.",
        "Responding to the same customer queries over and over again can be time consuming. Macros shorten your response time, while keeping your responses personalized. ",
        "Read more about macros in this article.",
        "By default, you'll see the standard conversation title, and details to the right of your inbox. ",
        "You can also add custom conversation attributes, or customize the Inbox with apps to show the exact information you need, and perform actions in external tools without needing to leave the conversation. ",
        "Inbox views allow you to define a set of filters, including conversation attributes, and then show all conversations that match those filters in real time. It’s easy to switch between them and keep an eye on urgent issues, your direct reports, or whichever conversations you consider most important.",
        "Keyboard shortcuts give you the option to perform common actions in the inbox without using your mouse. Just type \"Shift+?\" to get a full list of shortcuts. ",
        "You can also quickly insert stickers and smileys into conversations to make your conversations even more engaging. Simply type : and the word. For example, if you want to add a waving sticker, just type :  and wave and the sticker will appear for you to select. ",
        "Note: If you don't know the name of the sticker or emoji you want, you can always click on the smiley face icon to open the sticker menu. ",
        "Let Inbox rules handle the repetitive tasks, so your team can focus on what they do best.",
        "Check out this article to learn more about setting up Inbox rules.",
        "Some messages are too urgent to wait until tomorrow, or until your teammate returns from holidays. Everyone in your team is visible in the team inbox, so you can access any message for any teammate to ensure no question sits unanswered. ",
        "You'll find all new conversations in 'Unassigned' (unless they're automatically assigned using rules). You can pick any conversation up there and assign it to a particular teammate.",
        "Click the search icon on the top left to search and filter your conversations by keyword, tag, user, assignee, and date ranges. Locate relevant conversations instantly. For example, you can filter for a specific tag you’ve created to see all conversations about that topic:",
        "The Intercom for iOS and Intercom for Android mobile apps allows you to reply to visitors or users, add notes, assign conversations and view their profile pages. With mobile profile pages, it's easy to reply with high-quality, personalized responses from anywhere. Learn how to support your customers on the go here. ",

        "🟠 Using the new Inbox? You'll want to this article.",
        "As you chat to a lead you’ll begin to build a picture of who they are, what kind of company they work for, what problems they may be facing and how your business can help. Here’s how your team can qualify your leads and stay focused on the biggest opportunities: ",
        "Note: You’ll need Inbox to manually qualify leads in the inbox. ",
        "When an unknown visitor gets in touch with your team, they’ll automatically become a lead. And we’ll create a live profile for them, which will appear alongside their conversation in the inbox. You’ll see basic information about them, like their browser language and when they last visited your site. ",
        "Within each lead’s profile, you’ll see a customizable qualification section too. This allows your sales team to define and collect important information about your leads.",
        "By default, you’ll see the following user and company qualification data: ",
        "Name",
        "Email ",
        "Phone",
        "Company name ",
        "Company industry",
        "Company size ",
        "Company website",
        "It’s easy to change the qualification data that appears in your lead’s profile to suit your business needs. First, sit down with your sales team and define the key details that will help you convert your leads into users.",
        "For example, maybe it’s vital for your sales team to know your lead’s job title, whether they work for of a B2B or B2C company, the make of their car, etc. You can literally add any data you need to qualify them 😄 ",
        "Next, visit the ‘Qualification data’ section of your app settings and select ‘Add data.’ ",
        "Note: Adding or removing qualification data will change every lead’s qualification profile. ",
        "From here, you can choose which data appears and/or you can add your own data.",
        "To add your own qualification data, first select ‘Create new data.’ ",
        "Next, you’ll need to define the data you’d like to track. You can format your data in a few ways: as text, a number, a true or false answer, a date or a list. ",
        "For example, choose ‘text’ if you’d like your teammates to add a descriptive job title for your leads. ",
        "Once you’ve set up the right data, you can manually add information to your lead’s profile as you chat to them. ",
        "Important: If you add a company name to a lead’s profile that already exists, the lead will get added to that company. If the company doesn’t already exist, we’ll create a new company. ",
        "Each of your teammates can quickly check the qualification status of any lead to see where they are in the process. ",
        "It can sometimes be tricky to stay personal and friendly, while promptly getting the information you need. Here’s how to strike that balance: ",
        "It’s a good rule of thumb to only ask a lead question after you’ve given them a new piece of information. Always answer one question, before asking another. When your lead receives genuine help, they’ll be more receptive to answering your questions. ",
        "Your leads are tight on time, so make every question count. Only ask questions that help you understand what your lead needs and whether they’re a good fit for your business. Each answer you receive should help you add new qualification data to your lead’s profile. ",
        "It’s also important to only ask your leads for details they’ll be comfortable giving you over chat. If you’d like to know your lead’s revenue, for example, give them a multiple choice of ranges, instead of asking for one figure.",
        "Note: The lead qualification profile makes it easy to avoid asking questions you’ve already asked 😄 ",
        "While efficiency is key, don’t lose sight of your lead’s needs. Whenever you ask a lead a question, let them know how answering it will help them. They’ll be more likely to provide an informative answer when they know it will help them get what they need. ",
        "Remember, your leads are human too. Be friendly and conversational and avoid business-like robotic language. Use emojis, stickers and gifs often - people will appreciate your warm tone and will be more likely to continue the conversation.",
        "If someone’s not a good fit for your product, be upfront about it. Don’t try to sell them a solution that’s not for them; they’ll quickly churn. Instead, be transparent about the limitations of your product. This will save your sales team time, allowing you to focus on more promising opportunities. People will also trust your business more, and appreciate your honesty. ",
        "Once you successfully get a lead to sign up for your product they’ll become a user and they’ll get a user profile. All of the information you’ve gathered about them is carried over, and you can continue to qualify them. ",
        "Note: The qualification profile is collapsed by default for users. ",
        "Once a teammate expands/collapses this, it will expand/collapse for all conversations with leads and users. ",
        "It’s easy to edit data you’ve added about your lead. Just click over the qualification attribute: ",
        "Note: ",
        "You can hover over any qualification attribute on a lead’s profile to see which teammate last edited it, and when. ",
        "If you’d like to delete a qualification attribute a teammate has manually added, just select the arrow icon next to the attribute. Now, this data can get collected automatically from Operator or via ping. ",

You might need to loop in your manager to gather advice on how to reply. Similarly, if there’s a bug you can loop in a technical teammate to get their advice.

A good support team not only resolves each customer problem, but they’ll go one step further and tag each message. Over time, you’ll then gather a great store of valuable information about everything your customers are telling you - and it will all be easily searchable later. ",
        "Your engineers will want to hear about the impact of their bugs, for example, and your product team will want to know exactly where your customers are getting lost and confused. By tagging your messages and sharing your findings, you can make sure the right feedback is available to the right people in your company.",
        "To tag a conversation, simply go to the relevant message in that conversation and hover over the tag icon: ",
        "To tag conversations on the go, follow these steps:",
        "Long tap (hold your finger) on a conversation part.",
        "Select \"Tag this reply\".",
        "Search and choose from your existing tags, or tap \"Create new tag...\"",

        "When you and your team are consistently tagging over time, you'll amass valuable data that can inform how your product evolves. Tagging conversations with general tags like \"Bug\" or \"Feature Request\" lets you search for these things later and see all conversations about that topic. ",
        "But you should also be more specific and use tags to track conversations about a particular bug or feature like \"A/B Testing Bug\" or \"Events Feedback\". Over time, you'll start to see which requests are most common, or which bugs impact the most users. This kind of information will help your team prioritize bug fixes and decide what new features to build next.",
        "Below, we share just a few ways we categorize and tag our feedback at Intercom: ",
        "Even the best product teams ship bugs. When your users spot those bugs and report them, you need to let the relevant people know. To relay this to your team clearly and efficiently, tag it as ‘bug’ and leave a comment if necessary. Be sure to thank your customer for taking the time to report the issue, and if you really want to delight them, follow up and let  them know when it’s fixed.",
        "You and your team know your product better than anyone, right? But new users coming to it with fresh eyes and zero context are going to have a different perspective on it. That’s why customers will often ask what a feature means or how to use it. Those conversations generally begin something like this: “What does X mean?”, “I don’t understand why…” or “It doesn’t make sense to me that…”. This kind of feedback often shines a light on the product team’s blindspots and can help you improve your features.  ",
        "Your customers will request or ask about features that already exist in your product. These conversations highlight areas where you need to better communicate what your product can do. If you have an excellent events calendar in your product, but customers keep asking if it’s possible to record events, then you don’t have a product problem - you have an awareness problem. As well as your product team, your marketing or product education teams might want to know about this awareness issue. Tag it for them all. ",
        "Customers will often want your product to do more than it currently does. Take advantage of the fact that they are telling you exactly what they want. It’s important to let them know the product team will see their request, and to try and understand why they’re asking for that feature. ",
        "Pro Tip: Each quarter our research team generates a Customer Voice Report where they list the top 10 feature requests from our customers. This helps inform our product roadmap for the following quarter. Once you’ve been tagging your messages for long enough, creating this report is made far easier. ",
        "By tagging any feedback from churning customers you’ll be able to prevent it from happening later by taking action earlier in the cycle. If a customer is leaving because her own business is failing, that’s one thing. But if several customers are cancelling because of the recent feature “improvements” you made, then you’ve got an opportunity to directly address future churn. For example, you could send these folk a message asking what specifically they didn’t like about the feature and use this feedback to improve it. ",
        "If your site or app is down or unavailable you want to know how wide the impact on your customer base has been. Tagging these communications gives our infrastructure team a sense of how performance issues are impacting customers.",
        "This should be relatively easy and obvious to spot, but tag it so the relevant team or teams get the feedback. For example, it’s useful for a designer to know that the feature they’ve built is doing well and that customers are getting value from it. It’s also useful to have positive customer quotes that can be used in marketing materials. Just as important, remember to thank the user for sending it in.",
        "Read how to edit, archive or delete tags in this article. ",
        "Now that you’re tagging your conversations, you can get an overview of any trends with the Conversation tags report. You’ll gain insight into where your customers are confused, the features they request the most, how they’re impacted by bugs or outages, and much more. The report can also be exported so it’s easy to share.",

        "Type — Labelling different categories of conversation like ‘Bug’, ‘Feature request’, or ‘Question’ lets you see trends in real time views, or over time in reports.",
        "Urgency — Defining an urgency for each conversation is the perfect way to ensure that every customer gets the right level of support. For example, you might consider all conversations from VIP customers as high urgency.",

        "To create a new conversation attribute, go to Settings > Your workspace data > Conversation data, and click ‘+ Create attribute’:",
        "For our example ‘Product area’, let’s create a list attribute and add options for the different parts of the product (as the product changes we can always add or remove options):",
        "Note: The name may be visible to customers if you collect this information in conversations.",
        "Pro tip: Adding an emoji to each option makes the list easy to scan in your inbox. 😉",

        "Just select \"Required attribute\":",
        "Then, if a teammate attempts to close a conversation before providing this value, they'll be reminded to set it:",
        "Limit visibility for this attribute",
        "If the conversation data you're collecting is only relevant for certain conversations, you can limit its visibility to certain teams. ",
        "For example, your Sales team might set an attribute for each lead's intended use case, but this is no longer relevant for the folks in Customer Support:",
        "Note: If you set a conversation attribute as required, and limited to certain teams, only conversations assigned to those teams will require it.",
        "And that’s it. Just hit save and you’ll see your new attribute under ‘Conversation details’ in the inbox, where your team can easily set or update it as they chat with your customers:",
        "To choose a specific order in which the attributes should appear in the inbox, drag and drop them with the handle icon on the left: ",
        "Tags are very flexible, and applied to individual replies in a conversation. Useful for marking a particular part of the conversation so you can find it later. ",
        "Conversation data attributes are more structured, because you can define the data type that should apply: text, numbers, true/false or a list of values. They're perfect for ensuring consistency and categorising all of your conversations for reporting purposes. For example, by type, urgency, product area etc.",
        "Some examples:",
        "Number attributes let you attach a value to a conversation, for example if you have an attribute like “Order value”. You can then filter reports for conversations where order value is greater than a certain value.",
        "List attributes allow you to have exactly one of a set of values. For example, if you have a “Priority” attribute it could be set to \"high, medium, or low\". You can then use these attributes as filters for Inbox views, and conversations will move in and out of views in real time.",
        "Tags & conversation attributes can both be applied automatically by bots and Inbox rules, but only conversation attributes can be collected from your customers directly.",
        "To save your teammates time you can collect conversation data up front from your customers, then based on their answers, automatically assign conversations to the right team with the right service level and priority:",
        "It’s easy to set this up with the Support triage Task Bot. Just head to Operator > Task bots > For users, and choose the attributes you’d like to collect under ‘Get context about issues upfront’:",
        "Note: You can collect up to three attributes with this task bot, from logged in users only.",
        "Then, you can route and prioritize the conversation based on your customers’ responses. For this example, if the type is ‘Bug’, and the urgency is ‘High’, we’ll assign the conversation to the ‘VIP support’ team:",
        "Pro tip: If you need to collect more information from your users or visitors, or you’d like to collect certain attributes conditionally, you can do this with a Custom Bot from new conversations. ",
        "Conversation attributes can also be updated automatically by Inbox rules. For example, if a new message contains keywords like ‘Error’, ‘Bug’ or ‘Glitch’ rules can set the conversation type to ‘Bug’:",
        "Or, you may want to infer certain attributes based on other conversation information. These examples set the ‘Product area’ conversation attribute based on the URL where a conversation is started: ",
        "Tip: Rules can be triggered throughout the entire conversation to keep your conversation data up to date as things progress.",
        "To learn more about creating and managing Inbox rules, check out this article.",

        "Inbox views allow you to define a set of filters, then show all conversations that match those filters in real time. It’s easy to switch between views and keep an eye on urgent issues, your direct reports, or whichever conversations you consider most important.",
        "As an example, imagine you’ve just released an update to the ‘Projects’ feature in your product, and you’d like to monitor all serious bugs being reported. This view uses all three conversation attributes to show conversations where:",
