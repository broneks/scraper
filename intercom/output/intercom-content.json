And if you're using the mobile SDK and have notifications turned on, we'll send a mobile push notification to your customer as well.Note: Email or push notifications are only sent if the customer doesn't see your response in the Messenger first. Responses to email conversations are sent directly as emails. Read more about how Intercom sends notifications here."

For example, if your monthly spend is 10.4 you should round it to 10. If a user is associated with multiple companies we don't know which company's sessions to update, unless we have a company ID. So in order for the company's sessions to be updated, the user update has to contain the company object. Users can belong to multiple companies, but you should only send us the data for the company that the user is currently signed in with. You can also send other attributes within the company object. Those will be treated like custom attributes for that particular company. You can read more about custom attributes here."

Meaningful events will also make creating filters and auto-messages much easier.Send the right amount of metadata. Metadata is a great way to contextualise activity, but sending too much can be distracting. Remember that you can always link back to your own systems for more details.Format your metadata as if it were to be sent to a customer. Metadata is not formatted when included in your messages, so it must be ready to go when it's received by Intercom.Use events to understand user to user interactions like invitations and social activity. You can use metadata to provide a rich view of how users are interacting with your business and each other.Name your events in a way that makes them easily readable in Intercom. Using a past tense verb is one way to make the action more easily understood when it appears in the user activity timeline e.g. \"Purchased item\", \"Created profile\" or \"Viewed onboarding guide\"."

You just want to sound friendly, natural, and personal. This means things like; addressing them by their first name, asking how they are, and perhaps commenting on something outside the issue - like the weather in their city, for example. The great thing about this is that your customers will then mirror your tone. If you're being friendly and reasonable, your customers will too. If you maintain this tone all the time, even when the issue is resolved, your customers will feel more comfortable asking for help or providing feedback in the future.

It's not OK to send them an email a week after they last used the feature. It's unlikely that they'll open it, and even if they do, they're unlikely to remember exactly how they felt while using the feature."

More data equals more time spent analyzing it - so don't elicit more than you can handle, or need.Pick some customers who give interesting answers (both good and bad), and probe to keep the conversation going, or follow up with a Skype call. These customers are willing to give you honest feedback. How cool is that? Don't pass up that opportunity."

You will drown in them. But where do they come from, and which can you safely ignore?Getting insight into your userbase. There are 3 types of data that every Product Manager or application owner should have easy access to: User Activity, Product Usage, and Revenue.5 mistakes we all make with product feedback. It rarely makes sense to take feedback from all users and it never makes sense to get it all at once.3 rules for customer feedback. Gathering useful, timely feedback from customers can be a long process. Intercom makes it faster and easier than ever before but just because it's now easy to ask it doesn't mean it's a good idea to waste your customers' time. Answering a question well is always tougher than asking it.The blind product manager. Ask any product manager and they will tell you that seeing and talking to their users is critical to success. Yet few walk the walk and in effect, they are flying blind.Asking customers what you want to hear. There is nothing more insightful than learning how to improve your business directly from your customers. The challenge is asking the right questions.The right type of customer conversations. Conversations with customers are valuable, but they have to be the right type of conversations ‚Äì not merely questions about forgotten passwords and the like. They have to add value, for you, and them.Analyzing abandonment in your product. Conversion rates and usage patterns will cause you many a sleepless night. Your team deploys a new feature or flow, posts the announcement, then sits back and waits for glory. Instead, you get nothing.Conversations with your customers. You can't force a relationship with a customer without being pushy, awkward, or intrusive. So how is it done?Harnessing user research with Intercom. It's a given developers know their products better than their users but this can lead to a gulf in understanding between them. Listening to user feedback and watching their behaviour in your app will ensure you spot problems and can quickly solve them.Design principles: in-app messages. We recently released the second generation of a core Intercom feature, in-app messages. Redesigning a core-feature is always high risk, high reward. You have to be careful."

If you want to place a 20px gap under a paragraph of text, for example, it's best to add a row with an attribute of height=\"20\" Don't use padding, margins and floats as they won't always work (most notably with certain versions of Outlook).Inline all styles into your email to ensure that your styles get applied by each email client and to make sure that your design appears correctly when sent. To ease your workflow Intercom helps with that.You can use custom hosted web fonts from an open source font service like Google Fonts. All you have to do is embed the code in your email template. However, do note that if your email client doesn't support this, the text in your emails will fallback to use your websafe font.To create a responsive design, your width should be at least 320px but no more than 600px. And it's best to use a maximum width of 600px as your default view. It's also important to use media queries to transform your template into a single column at smaller viewports.For image file sizes, try to keep your images as small as possible (maximum 1MB in size). Downloading large images will provide a sub-optimal experience to your users, especially those who are viewing your email on mobile devices, as images may take a long time to appear. Use an email testing tool like Litmus to test your emails in all of your target email clients and browsers. It's not good enough to just look at your email in a regular browser or in one or two email clients. They all produce different results. Tools like Litmus give you full visibility of how your email will look everywhere."

You can target customers who were \"Last Seen\" less than 180 days ago, for example.Always get permission: You must have a recipient's permission to contact them with marketing communications.

This means that the CSS selectors may change every time a user accesses your product or site. In this case, you won't be able to use the automatic CSS selector to build your tour. You can edit some of the selectors to use a wildcard so that it ignores the dynamically generated piece of the CSS selector. This means editing the CSS to only selecting a part that is generic to all users. In the example below, we edit the selector to look for button__ rather than button__2kbli, as that part of the CSS appears to all users."

Express consent: This type of consent is a written or oral agreement that clearly shows consent to receive texts or calls. This could look like if a customer provides your business with a phone number as part of a business practice - i.e signing up for appointment reminders. However, if you gather consent via this method, then the content of any SMS messages sent must match the original business reason.

When the change occurs in Intercom, the sync to Salesforce is triggered immediately, while Salesforce is checked on 5 minute intervals to determine if there are changes to sync back to Intercom.Can I do a bulk update? Currently there is no bulk update of existing historical data when using the app. Data is only synced gradually i.e. from the point in time of configuration forward.What objects can I sync to Intercom? For now, you can sync Salesforce fields from Leads and Contacts to Intercom's people objects (you do not need to define whether it is an Intercom Lead or User object).Can I sync any Intercom attribute? You can sync most attributes. Some exceptions are read-only attributes, attributes in Intercom that change very frequently (e.g. last_seen) or formula fields (see next question).Can I sync Salesforce Formula fields? Formula fields are more complex and the syncing behaviour can depend on the Salesforce setup. In general formula fields can be mapped and synced to Intercom. However because this field is calculated, changes to this field will not initiate a trigger meaning that this field will only be synced when something else triggers the sync.Can I stop the app from syncing? Not directly. There is no option (other than uninstalling) to turn off the syncing.Can I use a sandbox account to test this first? Sure thing! You can test this new version using a test workspace with a Salesforce sandbox account."

We also encrypt data at rest.We regularly engage with well-regarded third-party auditors to audit our code-base and infrastructure, and work with them to resolve potential issues.We use technologies such as Graylog, AWS Cloudtrail and StreamAlert to provide an audit trail over our infrastructure and the Intercom application. Auditing allows to do ad-hoc security analysis, track changes made to our setup and audit access to every layer of our stack.We use two-factor authentication whenever possible. We ask vendors to enforce two factor authentication in all our accounts. We discourage use of shared accounts on any system - when we have no choice we use 1Password to securely share logins.
